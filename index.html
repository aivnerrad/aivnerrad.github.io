							<h2>Maryland born, West Virginia raised.</h2>
						</header>
						<p>As a kid, I was always interested in tech. In high school, I attended James Rumsey Technical Institute. I took Comptia A+ and Cisco CCNA classes while I was there. Since then, I have ventured around trying my hand in a few different things. I spent 6 years as a cook before being promoted into restaurant management. I had heard the moniker "Learn to code." multiple times, so I decided to give it a shot. After work, and on my days off, I would spend hours going through different online coding courses. I had gotten laid off due to Covid-19 and that allowed me to dive into my career as a software developer. I recently completed the 24-week course at App Academy, which sharpened all of my skills allowing me to thrive in a new role.</p>
